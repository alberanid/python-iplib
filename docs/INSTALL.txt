#  Requirements

* Python version 3 or later.


#  Install

Type, as root user:

   python ./setup.py install

If it doesn't work, copy the 'iplib.py' module it in your local site-packages directory.

Copy the example scripts 'ipconv', 'nmconv' and 'cidrinfo' from the ./bin directory to a directory included in your PATH environment variable (/usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/).

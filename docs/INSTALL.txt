  Requirements
  ------------

* Python version 2.3 or later.


  Install
  -------

Type, as root user:
   python ./setup.py install

If it doesn't work, copy the 'iplib.py' module it in your local
site-packages directory (i.e. /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/
or /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ if you're using Python 2.4).

Copy the example scripts 'ipconv', 'nmconv' and 'cidrinfo' from
the ./bin directory to a directory included in your PATH environment
variable (/usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/).
